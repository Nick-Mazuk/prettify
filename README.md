# Prettify

An extensible, language-agnostic code formatter based on [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) written in Rust.

The goal of this library is to provide a simple, fast, and extensible way to format code. Instead of formatting code for any specific language, it's language agnostic by accepting an intermediate representation instead of an AST.

That way, you can format code at the speed of Rust.
